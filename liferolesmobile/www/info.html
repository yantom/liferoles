	How to use this application
  </div>
  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
  <h2>1) Determine your roles</h2>
  <p>In this time management system each task is linked with a specific role. We all play multiple roles in our life e.g. <em>parent, partner, manager, lecturer, sportsman</em> and more. Tasks are assigned to each role and it is vital to include not only work tasks, but also personal and social tasks/roles. Don’t worry our <b>weekly planning functionality</b> makes this much easier than it sounds!</p>
  <br>
  <h2>2) Think about your personal mission and long-term goals</h2>
  <p>Personal mission statement should reflect your attitude to your roles and declare your steps on your way to success. Part of a personal mission could be: "As a sportsman, I will live healthy. I will keep in mind that sport helps me reduce stress ..."</p>
  <p>Role's goals should be more specific, long-term goals which you want to achieve. For example my long-term goal as a sportsman is "exercise regularly at least a month".</p>
  <br>
  <p>How will you use this app is up to you. If you use it just like a tasks list, you do not need to bother with personal mission and long-term goals at all. But we wanted to provide this opportunity to people who live with 7 habits :)</p>
  <br>
  <h2>3) Weekly planning</h2>
  <p>When you plan a day at a time, you can get bogged down in details and actually miss achieving the important tasks that you need to do. By planning weekly, you set aside specific time for the tasks that are not urgent, but are important for your long term success. This application has a simple layout for a weekly planning, which will make a difference to your productivity, happiness and growth.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Find your time for planning for example at Sunday and try to write down all tasks for the next week. From the beginning it may seems hard to plan the whole week but do not resign. After few weeks it will be easier and you will see the results. You can update your plan during the week, but try to stick with it.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>4) Four Quadrants</h2>
  <p>One of the most important thing of this system is to focus on the right tasks. We can divide tasks into four groups according to the importance and urgency.</p>
  <img style="float:left; width:50%" src="quadrants.png"/>
  <h3>1. Important and urgent</h3>
	<p>When something is important and urgent... <b>we should not ignore it!</b> The longer you ignore these tasks, the worse the situation will get for you and it is these tasks that cause the most stress. If we are honest with ourselves... most of these tasks could have been solved much earlier. That’s what the App encourages you to do.</p>
<h3>2. Important but not urgent</h3>
<p>This is the key quadrant in this system. You should try to focus on these tasks before they flow into the first quadrant i.e. a crisis. These tasks are not yet urgent (and you have some flexibility) but because they are important you still have to write them down and try to complete them! The weekly planning functionality means you can easily schedule these type of tasks.</p>
<h3>3. Urgent but not important</h3>
<p>These tasks are time killers which prevent us from success in the long-term. E.g. a public action that you have to do (because you have said that you will) but that has no actual benefit for you. These tasks may seem important at first glance, but at the end of the week you find out that they were not. We end up focusing on details which are actually not important. </p>
<h3>4. Not urgent nor important</h3>
<p>Things which we do because we feel that we need to rest. Rest is important, but hours spent watching tv is a rut lots of people fall into. We want you to question how you spend your free time and plan for quality time that leads to success in all aspects of your life.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>5) Manage your tasks</h2>
  <p>Now you know everything to get started. Go to the <em>Tasks</em> section and start planning! :)</p>

	Tips

  <div class="item item-text-wrap">
  <h2>Recommended way of planning</h2>
  <p>You are planning your week and have lots of tasks on your mind, but don't know which task assign to which day? Then create them in backlog.</p>
  <p>You can then drag and drop them, into the days that you want really quickly. This is the strategy which Stephen R. Covey recommends - first write down all tasks and then add them to your schedule.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Create role for unassignable tasks<h2>
  <p>You will quickly realize that you can't assign a role to all tasks. E.g. which role would you assign to task 'Buy socks'? Therefore, it is recommended for you to create specific role, called for example: <em>Other, Unassigned or TODO</em>, which will handle these tasks.</p>
